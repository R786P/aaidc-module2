# AAIDC Module 2: Architecting Agentic AI Systems

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project implements a **multi-agent system** as part of the **Agentic AI Developer Certification (AAIDC) – Module 2**. The system analyzes GitHub repositories of AI/ML projects and provides actionable suggestions to improve their presentation, discoverability, and completeness.

The system uses **CrewAI** as the orchestration framework and includes **3 specialized agents** with distinct roles:
1. **Researcher Agent** – Searches the web for similar projects
2. **Writer Agent** – Generates improvement suggestions
3. **Reviewer Agent** – Validates suggestions against repo content

All agents use **free, open-source LLMs** (Groq + Llama3) and **no paid APIs**, making it beginner-friendly and cost-free.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Stack Used
- **Orchestration**: CrewAI (simple, powerful, beginner-friendly)
- **LLM**: Groq API with `llama3-8b-8192` (free tier available)
- **Tools**: 
  - Tavily Search Tool (free web search)
  - GitHub Repo Reader (built-in, no API key needed)
  - RAG Retriever (local README analysis)
- **Agent Roles**:
  - Researcher → Finds similar projects
  - Writer → Suggests improvements
  - Reviewer → Fact-checks suggestions

## ✅ Key Features
- ✅ 3+ agents with distinct roles
- ✅ Multi-agent collaboration via CrewAI
- ✅ Tool integration (web search, repo reader, RAG)
- ✅ Free LLM (Groq) — no OpenAI API key needed
- ✅ Clean, documented code with setup instructions
